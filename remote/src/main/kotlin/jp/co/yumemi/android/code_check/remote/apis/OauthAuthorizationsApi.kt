The [OAuth Authorizations API](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).  **Warning:** Apps must use the [web application flow](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow) to obtain OAuth tokens that work with GitHub SAML organizations. OAuth tokens created using the Authorizations API will be unable to access GitHub SAML organizations. For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api).  Creates OAuth tokens using [Basic Authentication](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication). If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see \&quot;[Working with two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#working-with-two-factor-authentication).\&quot;  To create tokens for a particular OAuth application using this endpoint, you must authenticate as the user you want to create an authorization for and provide the app&#39;s client ID and secret, found on your OAuth application&#39;s settings page. If your OAuth application intends to create multiple tokens for one user, use &#x60;fingerprint&#x60; to differentiate between them.  You can also create tokens on GitHub from the [personal access tokens settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page. Read more about these tokens in [the GitHub Help documentation](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use).  Organizations that enforce SAML SSO require personal access tokens to be allowed. Read more about allowing tokens in [the GitHub Help documentation](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on).
